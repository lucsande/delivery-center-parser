# DeliveryCenterParser

This is a small Rails API project, with just a single endpoint: `POST /api/v1/orders`. 

It receives a JSON with data about an order from a fictional Marketplace, parses it so it is compatible with a fictional Delivery Center API, validates if all required fields are present and then send the parsed order to the Delivery Center API; When order requests can't be processed, error logs are generated and stored in the DB, allowing further monitoring and debugging.

You can test the application by running `rails s` in your terminal and then use Postman or similar services to make requests to 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/orders'. Make sure your requests have the header 'Content-Type: application/json' and that its body is in the following format:

## Automated Tests
This project uses rspec as its testing framework. You can run the tests yourself by running `rails spec` on your terminal. You can explore the project's test coverage by opening the file `coverage/index.html`.


## TODO
Unfortunately, for lack of time, some things are still pending, for instance:
- validate attributes presence, uniqueness, etc in models;
- check if order already exists in DB before sending it to Delivery Center API, so duplicates are not sent;
